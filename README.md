## How do I get edit access to my repo?
By default you have read access to all repos in the organisation [ewfx](https://github.com/ewfx). To gain edit access to your repo, you need to request access to a Github team with the same name as your repo. Goto [Github Teams](https://github.com/orgs/ewfx/teams) and search for your repo name. Click on your team name and click on the "Request to Join" button. One of the admins will approve your request. It is recommended that only the Team Leader gets the edit rights to a repo.

## How do I add collaborators to my repo?
Once you have gained edit access to the repo, you can goto project Settings -> Collaborators and teams -> Add People. You can add people who have not yet joined the organisation by adding them as an outside collaborator.
