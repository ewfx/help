## 🤖 How Does Automatic Evaluation Work?
The evaluation process consists of **two stages**:  

### **1️⃣ Elimination Stage** (Basic Checks ✅)  
Your repository must meet the following criteria to proceed to scoring:  
✔ **At least one new commit** after repo creation.  
✔ **All commits must be before** the cutoff time of **9 PM on the 26th**.  
✔ **README** is updated with **proper details** about the solution.  
✔ **Demo slides and videos** are available in **`artifacts/demo/`** folder.  
✔ **All source code files** are available in **`code/src/`** folder.  
✔ **All test files** (if any) are available in **`code/test/`** folder.  

⚠ **Repos failing these checks will not move to AI-based scoring.**

### **2️⃣ AI-Based Scoring Stage** (2nd Round Evaluation 🔥)  
If a repo passes the elimination stage, it will be **evaluated on five key parameters**:  

📌 **Design & Approach** – How well thought-out is the solution?  
📌 **Completeness of Solution** – Does it fully address the problem statement?  
📌 **Code Quality** – Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?  
📌 **Test Results** – Are there sufficient tests, and do they pass?  
📌 **Overall Score** – A holistic evaluation of the project.  

🚀 **AI Based scores will be provided as an input to the manual/human scoring rounds**
